# Overview

Site was created from an open source single page website that was simple.  This will probably never be updated or finalized.  The code generated from the sass templates and how that worked was not explicity stated and something I didn't necessarily want to dive as deep as necessary to make this work completely right.

Base repo for the 'global site' can be found [here](https://github.com/BuckyMaler/global)
